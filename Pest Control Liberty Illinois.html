Pesticides are often referred to by the type of pestthey control: insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, rodenticides, anddisinfectants.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What You Should Knowabout Pesticides</span><br>Think how many pesticides exist around your home—in the garage, underthe kitchen sink, or in the backyard shed. All-purpose insecticides forthe garden, weed &amp; feed for your lawn, indoor ant and roachsprays, outdoor foggers, insect repellents, flea &amp; tick collarsand shampoos, weed killer for the driveway—even chlorine bleach—all ofthese products are pesticides commonly found in homes.<br>Too often people mistakenly think many pesticides are "safe" justbecause they can be purchased at the local hardware store, gardensupply, or supermarket.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Absolutely not!</span><br><br>Pesticides are designed to be toxic. Each time you apply a pesticidethere may be unintended consequences.&nbsp; People (especiallychildren and the elderly), pets and beneficial organisms may beaffected.&nbsp; Water quality and aquatic life may also be impactedby outdoor applications.&nbsp; <br>To protect yourself and others, read and follow pesticide labelscarefully. The label is a legal document that tells what pests theproduct controls and where and how it can be applied. Not following thelabel is actually a violation of federal law. The label also tells howto mix, store, and dispose of unused portions and empty containers. Forgarden use products, it says which crops can be treated and how longyou must wait before picking a treated food crop.<br><br>It is wise to read the label before buying a pesticide, as well asbefore every application, even if you think you are familiar with theproduct. Don't rely on your memory.<br>Always use the exact amount as directed by the label (or less if itworks) and under the conditions specified for the purpose listed. Usingany pesticide in a way not consistent with the label is illegal andunsafe. Don't think double strength makes for a better product. Itdoesn't. Improper use increases risk. Of course, only use pesticides asa last resort.<br><h2>Professional Pest Control</h2>Pest management professionals (PMPs) were called exterminators or pestcontrol operators in the past. They are certified applicators who havethe training and knowledge to treat pest problems. They can also applyrestricted use products. PMPs can be classified as either private orcommercial applicators depending on their type of license. PMPs mayapply pesticides to various locations including: agricultural settings,homes, businesses, farms, schools, parks, roadways, railways, forests,vineyards, public lands, and others.<br><br>PMPs are trained to handle complex pest problems. For example, they may:<br><ul>  <li>Have special training and experience applying restrictedproducts, which may be highly toxic or difficult to apply</li>  <li>Identify difficult-to-control pests and have expertknowledge of their life cycles</li>  <li>Recognize environmental situations that could be vulnerableto pesticide contamination, such as nearby streams or natural areas </li></ul>If a professional applicator is going to apply a pesticide in yourarea, you can contact your state pesticide regulatory agency to inquireabout state pesticide laws. You can also ask whether the applicator hasa current license. Regardless of their training and experience, aprofessional applicator is still required to read and follow the labeldirections for the product. The label is the law.<br>State pesticide regulatory agencies require PMPs to undergoprofessional training, testing, and continuing education to maintaintheir licenses.<br><br>The state pesticide regulatory agency requires knowledge and skills insubjects such as:<br><ul>  <li>Reading and understanding pesticide labels</li>  <li>Application and mixing technique</li>  <li>Pesticide laws and regulations</li>  <li>Safety, protective equipment, and pesticide hazards</li>  <li>Storage, handling, use and disposal of pesticides and theircontainers</li>  <li>What to do if a pesticide is spilled at the work site</li></ul><br><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/doublegpestcontrol/Pest+Control+Payson+Illinois.htmll" target="_blank">More info</a><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Press Releases</span><br><a href="https://goo.gl/LmvXwK">https://goo.gl/LmvXwK</a><br><a href="https://goo.gl/keRS1U">https://goo.gl/keRS1U</a><br><a href="https://goo.gl/z2zsGa">https://goo.gl/z2zsGa</a><br><a href="https://goo.gl/Tf2v1g">https://goo.gl/Tf2v1g</a><br><a href="https://goo.gl/tMsW4n">https://goo.gl/tMsW4n</a><a href="https://goo.gl/tMsW4n"><br>https://goo.gl/aSm18U</a><br><a href="https://goo.gl/BCmtne">https://goo.gl/BCmtne</a><a href="https://goo.gl/BCmtne"><br>https://goo.gl/BSgssB</a><br><br><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=12XlJey7ZOfmOo4LKh8Ge12rx0nCT6oRE" width="640" height="480"></iframe><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTkVA0iykgVTw4UbzDTbbP4jE8QeGnyB1EfvoNQj_wlLHtTRujEPYhyrRBsUzVgKj6YRuLH7gBW62P4/pub">Pest Control Liberty Illinois</a><br> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTkVA0iykgVTw4UbzDTbbP4jE8QeGnyB1EfvoNQj_wlLHtTRujEPYhyrRBsUzVgKj6YRuLH7gBW62P4/pub">Liberty Illinois Pest Control</a><br> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTkVA0iykgVTw4UbzDTbbP4jE8QeGnyB1EfvoNQj_wlLHtTRujEPYhyrRBsUzVgKj6YRuLH7gBW62P4/pub">Pest Control Liberty IL</a><br> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTkVA0iykgVTw4UbzDTbbP4jE8QeGnyB1EfvoNQj_wlLHtTRujEPYhyrRBsUzVgKj6YRuLH7gBW62P4/pub">Liberty IL Pest Control</a><br> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTkVA0iykgVTw4UbzDTbbP4jE8QeGnyB1EfvoNQj_wlLHtTRujEPYhyrRBsUzVgKj6YRuLH7gBW62P4/pub">Exterminator Liberty Illinois</a><br> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTkVA0iykgVTw4UbzDTbbP4jE8QeGnyB1EfvoNQj_wlLHtTRujEPYhyrRBsUzVgKj6YRuLH7gBW62P4/pub">Liberty Illinois Exterminator</a><br> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTkVA0iykgVTw4UbzDTbbP4jE8QeGnyB1EfvoNQj_wlLHtTRujEPYhyrRBsUzVgKj6YRuLH7gBW62P4/pub">Exterminator Liberty IL</a><br> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTkVA0iykgVTw4UbzDTbbP4jE8QeGnyB1EfvoNQj_wlLHtTRujEPYhyrRBsUzVgKj6YRuLH7gBW62P4/pub">Liberty IL Exterminator</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
